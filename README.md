# Warder and Prisoner Game

## Overview
**Warder and Prisoner** is a two-player strategic game where one player takes on the role of the **Warder** while the other is the **Prisoner**, competing on a dynamic 5x5 block map. The **Warder**'s goal is to capture the **Prisoner**, while the **Prisoner** aims to escape by reaching a tunnel. The game operates using a client-server architecture, with the server managing the game flow and handling multiple clients.

### Key Features:
- **5x5 Block Grid**: The map consists of randomly distributed **free**, **obstacle**, and **tunnel** blocks.
- **Character Roles**: Players are randomly assigned the role of **Warder** or **Prisoner** at the start of each game.
- **Turn-Based Gameplay**: Players take alternating turns, with a 10-second limit for each move.
- **Win Conditions**:
  - **Warder Victory**: The warder wins by reaching the prisoner's block.
  - **Prisoner Victory**: The prisoner wins by reaching the tunnel block.
- **Automatic Game Reset**: The server can reset the game board and player scores to restart the match.

## Extra Features: 
- **Single Player Mode**: Player can play with bot.

## Game Rules

   - The map consists of:
     - 19 **free** blocks that both players can access.
     - 5 **obstacle** blocks that neither player can cross.
     - 1 **tunnel** block, accessible only to the prisoner.

2. **Randomized Setup**:
