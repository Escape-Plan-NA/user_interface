**Welcome to Escape Plan** – a thrilling two-player game of wits and strategy! One player takes on the role of the **Warder**, while the other becomes the **Prisoner**. Can you escape to freedom or capture the fugitive? Only time (and strategy) will tell.

## 🚀 Project Overview
Escape Plan is a client-server game that lets two players connect, strategize, and compete for the win. One computer hosts the **server** and a **game client**, while the other is a standalone **game client** that connects to the server. Each player must move their character wisely within the time limit and aim to outsmart their opponent. 

### Key Features

- **Multiplayer Setup**: Host a server and connect two clients to play.
- **Role Assignment**: Each game, players are randomly assigned the roles of **Warder** or **Prisoner**.
- **Win Conditions**:
  - **Warder** wins by catching the **Prisoner**.
  - **Prisoner** wins by reaching the **tunnel** block.
- **Score Tracking**: Server keeps track of scores and displays the winner's name and current score after each game.
- **Server Controls**: Admin can reset the game and player scores at any time.
- **Map Randomization**: The server shuffles the map and assigns characters for each game to keep it exciting.
